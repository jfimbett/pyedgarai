# Comparables Analysis Module

## Instructions

Confidential, for internal use only. Do not distribute.

**Description**: This module provides the user the ability to *compare* public companies to a target company. 


**Note for the developer**: Most functionality will be provided by an API that handles the data querying and processing. For completeness we provide the exact API endpoints that we believe are required for each task. All API endpoints require a `api_token` parameter which for testing puroses is set to `t3stt@ken` and is ignored in the examples for simplicity. The full documentation of the API as well as an interface for testing is available at 
https://pyedgarai-jfimbett.replit.app/openapi
### Identification of firms to compare. 

#### Task 1: Search bar for firms

The first requirement of the module is a search bar for firms, using different type of identifiers (CIK, ticker, name, etcâ€¦) via which the user selects a company for which the comparables will be retrieved. This implies a connection to the API endpoint of the backend. There are two API endpoints necessary for this task: `/cik_tickers`, and `/cik_names`. Apart from the `api_token` these endpoints do not require any additional parameter. 

Example:
```bash 
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://pyedgarai-jfimbett.replit.app/cik_tickers?api_token=t3stt%40ken' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

Response
```json
{
"0000012040": [
    "BDL"
  ],
  "0000012208": [

where the keys are the CIKS (treated as strings with leading zeros) and the values are lists of tickers. Note how one CIK can have multiple tickers, this happens when a company has different classes of shares.

Equivalently for the `/cik_names` endpoint the response is a dictionary with the keys being the CIKs (without the leading zeros) and the values being the names of the companies.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://pyedgarai-jfimbett.replit.app/cik_names?api_token=t3stt%40ken' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
Response
```json
{
  "1750": "AAR CORP",
  "1800": "ABBOTT LABORATORIES",
  "1961": "WORLDS INC.",
  "2098": "ACME UNITED CORP",
  "2178": "ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC.",
  "2186": "BK Technologies Corporation",
  ...
}
```

The module can perform a request to both endpoints and with the information queried to provide the user with a search bar that can search by CIK, ticker, or company name. The search bar should be able to autocomplete the search query. We require a single input for the search bar that accepts the three types of identifiers, and the user should be able to select the company from the search bar. In the options, provide the complete name of the company, the ticker, and the CIK.

#### Task 2: Add a new company for comparable search. 


If the user wants to add his own company (that is not part of the database) a new section should open where the user can either import data from a document (this functionality will be provided by another module and it is not required at the moment) or input data for the new firm. The user should be able to input the basic information of the company (name), and select the industry and specific accounting variables to fill. The variables that the user can choose to fill are provided in endpoint
